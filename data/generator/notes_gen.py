 NOTES, RECORDS AND QUERIES  (Plan §3.1, §3.5, §3.6)
=============================================================================

Engineer notes carry what NO SENSOR SEES: a valve left open, a strainer
cleaned, a handover comment, a rumour about coal quality. They are what makes
tier B and tier C episodes unsolvable from the numbers alone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 IMPORTANT: these are TEMPLATE-GENERATED, not LLM-generated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The plan calls for LLM generation with a plant-shorthand style prompt,
 followed by hand-reading all ~150 notes. Templates are the honest
 placeholder: they get the pipeline running today, and they are the KNOWN
 WEAKNESS -- listed in Plan §14 as "synthetic notes are too clean and make
 tier B trivial", likelihood HIGH.

 Before any tier-B/C result is reported, replace `build_notes` with an LLM
 pass through `--style plant_shorthand` and hand-read the output. The T8
 ablation will expose it if the notes are too easy, but do not wait for the
 ablation to notice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every episode is salted with distractors (§3.5):
   3-8 irrelevant notes about unrelated equipment in the same time range
   a stale note about the same tag from six weeks ago
   in 3 episodes, a note that CONTRADICTS the sensors (sensors win, and the
     agent should flag the conflict rather than silently pick one)
   in 2 episodes, a note containing instruction-like text (scored under T9)
