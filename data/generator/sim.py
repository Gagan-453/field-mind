 PHYSICS-LITE BOILER SIMULATOR  (Plan §3.6)
=============================================================================

Generates the six-tag time series for one episode.

THE KEY DESIGN RULE: faults are injected at DRIVER level, never by editing a
tag afterwards. A fault sets `feed_valve_effectiveness = 0.77` and every
downstream tag then moves because the physics moves it. That is what keeps
all six tags mutually consistent, so a fault shows up as a genuine
MULTI-SIGNAL PATTERN rather than a dent in one trace.

The second key rule: GROUND TRUTH IS EMITTED BY THE GENERATOR, not written
afterwards. It knows exactly which driver it changed and when, so labels
cannot drift from the data.

Two balances must close, and the check layer relies on both:
    WATER   d(m_liquid)/dt = feed - steam - blowdown - leak         [kg/s]
            indicated level = liquid level (mass / geometry) + shrink-swell(p)
    ENERGY  pressure and bed temperature respond to heat in vs heat absorbed

INTERNAL UNITS ARE SI (kg, s, Pa, K, m3). The six emitted columns keep their
engineering units (t/h, %, kg/cm2(g), degC); conversion happens at emit.
Every constant is DERIVED / CITED / FITTED / STANDARD / ASSUMED per
data/physics/DERIVATIONS.md -- the section reference is on each line.

REWRITE STATUS (staged, per CLAUDE.md "one stage at a time"):
    [x] sub-model 1  water balance + shrink-and-swell (drho_g/dp)   -- THIS FILE
    [x] sub-model 2  energy balance: coal ultimate analysis -> stoichiometric
                     air + Dulong GCV; steam-table pressure integrator with a
                     PHYSICAL pressure capacitance e_p (NOT fitted to the
                     drum_pressure ar1 timescale); bed / ms deviation gains
                     each derived from the combustion mass/energy balance.
    [ ] sub-model 3  dissolved-solids balance
    [ ] sub-model 4  cross-correlated OU drivers + fingerprint measurement noise
The load-swing placeholder (`swing`) and the emit-noise dict are still
PRE-REWRITE, replaced in sub-model 4.

Run  `python3 -m data.generator.sim`  for self-tests, direction checks and an
independent re-derivation of the shrink-and-swell gain.

Everything here runs OFFLINE on the host. numpy is fine.
