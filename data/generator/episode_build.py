 EPISODE BUILDER  (Plan §3.3 catalogue, §3.4 tiers, §3.5 distractors)
=============================================================================

Builds all 30 episodes: 6 normal + 24 faults across five families.

    N  6  normal, load swings, soot-blow          tests false positives
    A  6  water side, feed path                   feed < steam, heat side untouched
    B  5  water side, leak                        feed > steam yet level only holds
    C  6  fuel / heat side                        pressure and bed fall together
    D  4  bed temperature                         bed climbs at steady load
    E  3  slow drift                              nothing crosses a limit

MODALITY-NECESSITY TIERS (§3.4) -- the most important dataset decision. If
every episode were solvable from the time series alone we would have built a
time-series benchmark with text stapled on, and the multimodal claim would be
empty. So:

    tier A  12  solvable from the numbers alone
    tier B  12  needs the numbers plus ONE text source
    tier C   6  needs two sources, or memory of a past episode

The evaluator checks tier compliance directly (T8): run with text removed and
confirm tier B/C accuracy collapses. If it does not, the episode is
mislabelled and gets rebuilt.

Run:  python -m data.generator.episode_build --out data/episodes
