# BENCHMARK, BACK TO BACK (lockstep): the presentation episodes on the
# MULTI-AGENT system with NO wall-clock pacing. Each tick waits for all of its
# model answers, publishes, and the next tick starts at once -- the way the
# single-agent presentation runs were made (scripts/presentation_all.sh), so
# the two can be put side by side. This is NOT the real-time demonstration
# (scripts/presentation_multi_all.sh, a tick every 30 s that never waits).
#
#     scripts/benchmark_multi_lockstep_all.sh                       # all six
#     scripts/benchmark_multi_lockstep_all.sh ep_A01_fcv_seize      # only these
#
# Same setup as the demonstration (configs/fast.yaml: Llama 3.2 3B on the NPU
# lane for the water and heat diagnosticians, Gemma 3 1B on the CPU lane for
# the verifier and text reader; lanes restarted fresh before every episode
# with -c 4096 -np 1 -fit off --cache-ram 0 -lv 4). What differs in lockstep:
#   * model calls run one after another, never two lanes at once;
#   * an answer is used in the tick that asked for it (no one-tick delay) and
#     the verifier runs on every tick its trigger fires;
#   * the board works without pauses, so it heats like the single-agent runs.
# The job start / finish times inside `multi.results` are the scheduler's
# SIMULATED clock in this mode; the real time of every call is `latency_ms`
# in its envelope, and the real time of a tick is `tick_latency_ms`.
#
# Answers are held to the grammars of fieldmind/multi/grammar.py (multi.grammar,
# on in configs/fast.yaml since 2026-10-05), so results go to a "grammar"
# folder and are never mixed with, or resumed over, the runs made before that.
#
# Every result file carries the suffix _multi (the single agent's carry _single), so a
# file copied out of its folder still says which agent made it.
# Per episode, in $OUT (a folder of its own, never mixed with the real-time run):
#   <ep>_multi.log            the live display, written as it is shown
#   <ep>_multi.ticks.jsonl    every tick's full assessment, appended as it is published
#   <ep>_multi.run.json.gz    every tick (written when the episode finishes)
#   <ep>_multi.summary.json   the evaluation
#   <ep>_multi.lanes.txt      the lane startup lines that prove NPU / CPU placement
#   temps_multi.jsonl       chip temperature before and after
# An episode that already has <ep>_multi.summary.json is skipped, so the same command
# resumes after Ctrl-C (the interrupted episode starts over). The next episode
# waits until the chip is within 5 C of the reading taken at the start of this
# batch, for at most 900 s (the single-agent script's margin and limit).
# Live view: .venv/bin/python bench/stage_monitor_multi.py   (second terminal)
# BACKEND=mock checks this script on the laptop without the board; mock output
# goes to its own folder and is never an agent result.
