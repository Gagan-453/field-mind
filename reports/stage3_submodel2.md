# Stage 3 / sub-model 2 — energy balance (coal stoichiometry + steam-table pressure integrator) — report

## Status
DONE — the pre-rewrite energy block in `sim.py` (`PRESS_GAIN = 4.0` and the five
bare `bed_target` literals `900 / 250 / 450 / 400 / -200`) is replaced by:

- **One coal ultimate analysis** (ASSUMED, ranges), from which **both** `air_st`
  (5.471 kg/kg) and `GCV` (4040 kcal/kg, Dulong) are DERIVED — not chosen
  independently. Dulong consistency (`GCV_kcal / air_st` in the fuel-independent
  700–780 kcal/kg-air band) is a self-test.
- **Steam-table duty**: `Q_steam_nom = 51.5 MW`, `m_coal_nom = 3.58 kg/s`,
  DERIVED from IF97 enthalpies.
- **Physical pressure integrator**: `dp/dt = (Q_evap_supply − W_steam·hfg) / E_P`
  with `E_P = 679 J/Pa` from boiler-water + metal thermal mass × `dTsat/dp`.
  **Not** fitted to the 44.53-min `drum_pressure` ar1 timescale (correction 1).
- **Bed / ms** first-order lags (τ_bed ≈ 6 min, τ_ms ≈ 55 s — kept fast per the
  CLAUDE.md stage-1 correction) toward a target built from deviation gains, each
  DERIVED from the combustion mass/energy balance via a bed conductance
  `G_BED_EFF = G_FG + G_WW` (flue gas **plus** the in-bed water-wall clamp).

Load-swing placeholder and emit-noise dict are still pre-rewrite (sub-model 4).
Episodes NOT regenerated. `configs/base.yaml` NOT touched.

## Verification
| step | result |
|---|---|
| ran the module | `python3 -m data.generator.sim` — **exit 0**. Full output below. One expected `RuntimeWarning` (family-A inventory-clamp guard, as in sub-model 1). |
| self-tests | `_self_test()` — **7 groups pass**: (1–3) sub-model-1 water-side invariants unchanged; (4) **coal consistency** `GCV_kcal/air_st = 739` in [700, 780]; the inconsistent `(3400, 5.46)` pair → 623, fails the band (asserted); (5) no-fault 90-min run holds pressure ±1 kg/cm2 and bed ±20 °C with **no fitted constant**; (6) `E_P = 679` within 2× of the physical band and >5× below the ar1-fit `1.3e4`; (7) family-E fouling (0.985, 220 min) bed max < 880 (crosses no limit) yet rises ≥ 8 °C. |
| direction checks | **8 / 8 OK** (checks 1, 2, 5 no longer PROVISIONAL; 6–8 are new). Table below. |
| independent re-derivation | **air_st**: code uses the mass-fraction shortcut; independent kmol-balance route gives **5.4673 vs 5.4707**, **0.06 %**. **GCV**: code uses Dulong; independent **Boie** correlation gives **4116 vs 4040 kcal/kg**, **1.88 %**. Both routes are different arithmetic on the same ultimate analysis. |
| mutation check | 4 energy mutations, all caught (details below). M3/M4 are the **E10 non-double-count proof**. |

RCA case-wording cross-checks: Case 11 (tube leak) "bed temperature dropped
sharply" — matches check 6 sign. Case 4 (sharp load rise) "MS temperature fell
from 492 to 428 degC in about eight minutes" — matches check 8 sign (our
transient dip is smaller; see disagreement 3).

## Disagreements recorded, not resolved
1. **`e_p` derived (679 J/Pa) vs correction 1's physical band (0.8–1.2e3 J/Pa).**
   The derivation is water-sensible-dominated: `M_bw·cp_bw·dTsat/dp = 550` of the
   679, with `M_bw` from geometry and `cp_bw`/`dTsat/dp` from IF97; the metal
   term (~90) carries the only free input (`M_drum_metal`). 679 is **~1.2×**
   below the correction's low end — inside 2×, **no stop-rule**, and it is
   **not** a fit-vs-physics gap (both figures are physics). The gap that matters
   is against the value an ar1 fit to `drum_pressure.timescale_minutes = 44.53`
   would demand, `~1.3e4 J/Pa` — **19×** the derived value. Per CLAUDE.md that
   19× *is* the diagnosis: the 44.53-min timescale is inherited input slowness,
   not the plant's pressure response. **Chosen:** the derived 679 J/Pa.
   Achieved `drum_pressure` autocorrelation is reported after **sub-model 4**,
   once the OU load driver supplies the slow wander.
2. **Coal GCV: 4040 (Dulong, this stage) vs 3400 (`notes_gen.base_cv` and the
   `data/kb` coal reports, unchanged).** The correction is explicit — an
   analysis giving `air_st ≈ 5.46` implies `GCV ≈ 4000–4100`, so the ASSUMED
   3400 is inconsistent with the ASSUMED stoichiometric air. `sim.py` now uses
   4040 (DERIVED, one analysis, Dulong self-test). `notes_gen.base_cv` and the
   on-disk `records.json` coal reports still say 3400 (the feeder *calibration
   basis*). **Chosen:** move `sim.py` now; `notes_gen.base_cv` and the coal
   reports should be brought to ~4040 at the **next episode regeneration**
   (out of scope this stage — episodes not regenerated, as in sub-model 1).
   Until then `coal_cv_factor = 1.0` in the simulator corresponds to 4040 kcal/kg
   physical while the report text says 3400 — a documented, temporary skew.
3. **E12 — ms vs load: RCA Case 4 vs the fingerprint.** RCA Case 4 records ms
   **falling** on a sharp load rise (492 → 428 °C in ~8 min; mechanism: firing
   lag + swell carry-over + a *passing attemperator spray valve*). The
   fingerprint's steady-state `ms_temperature` level-regression on load gives
   **+0.31 °C/(t/h) at R² 0.028** (`delta_1h` +0.56 at R² 0.065) — i.e. **not a
   relationship**. **Modelled:** the Case 4 transient direction —
   `K_MS_FLOW = 0.45 °C/(t/h) > 0`, so more steam mass through a fixed
   superheater surface gives a transient ms dip that then recovers as the bed
   catches up (direction check 8: −2.2 °C dip → +4.6 °C recovery). The
   fingerprint's +0.31 slope is **not** imposed, because (a) R² 0.03 is not a
   fit, (b) it is a different boiler (774 °C bed, 99.6 kg/cm2), (c) our
   attemperator/spray is not modelled, so steady-state ms control is out of
   scope. Our modelled steady-state |ms~load slope| stays within the
   fingerprint's own scatter. Case 4's full −64 °C is not reproduced (the
   passing spray valve, the dominant term there, is not a driver in this sim).
4. **E8 — `primary_air` valid range.** The model raises bed temperature
   *monotonically* as PA falls (`K_PA·(1 − min(1, PA))`), with **no
   air-limited turnover**. Below
   `PRIMARY_AIR_MIN = 1 − (LAMBDA_EXCESS − 1)/(PA_AIR_FRACTION·LAMBDA_EXCESS)
   = 0.636`, primary + secondary air can no longer meet stoichiometric demand,
   and a real bed would go sub-stoichiometric (CO up, bed temp rolls over) —
   which this model does not represent. **The `primary_air` driver is only
   physical on [0.64, ~1.15].** Family D uses 0.80 and 0.84, both inside it;
   direction check 7 asserts the bound so a future schedule cannot cross it
   silently. Recorded, not "fixed" — adding an air-limited rollover would be a
   new ASSUMED coefficient with no reference.
5. **Family E02 (`heat_absorption = 0.989`) drift rate may be below the L1
   long-drift threshold.** E02 bed rises ~+12 °C over its ~180-min ramp
   ≈ 0.067 °C/min, against `configs/base.yaml rates_long.bed_temp_avg.threshold
   = 0.08 °C/min` (sustained 40 min). E01 (0.986, +20 °C) and E03 (0.985,
   +15 °C) clear it. The threshold is flagged in `base.yaml` as "expect to tune
   in phase 2" and is **not** touched here. If E02 must trigger the drift check,
   either the threshold drops in the config-retune stage or E02's severity is
   raised in a scoped stage — **not decided here**.
6. **Family C severe (`fuel_availability = 0.62`, feeder trip) bed → ~772 °C
   (−78 °C).** This is dominated by the load-following term (`steam` collapses
   to ~41 t/h → `K_BED_LOAD·(41 − 67) ≈ −72`). A −78 °C average-bed drop for a
   half-feeder trip is on the strong side; RCA does not quantify it. Direction
   is correct ("pressure and bed fall together"), magnitude is plausible but
   unverified. Recorded.
7. **Deep pressure dip on a *fast* load step.** A 67 → 77 t/h step ramped over
   **2 min** (the direction-check stimulus) drops pressure ~8 kg/cm2 before the
   firing controller (τ ≈ 60 s, proportional p-trim, no feedforward) recovers
   it. Real units with load feedforward would dip less. Gentle episode ramps
   (N03/N05 use 10 min) produce a negligible dip (< 0.5 kg/cm2). This is a
   magnitude to watch, not a direction failure; bounded by the `throttle`
   coupling (steam cannot be pulled at rated flow on low pressure).

## Blocked / needs a decision
No new stop-rule hits. Decisions deferred to later stages:
- **(a)** `notes_gen.base_cv` / `data/kb` coal-report GCV: 3400 → ~4040 at the
  next episode regeneration (disagreement 2).
- **(b)** L1 thresholds tuned against the old energy physics —
  `checks.rates.drum_pressure`, `checks.balance.p_falling` / `bed_rising`,
  `checks.rates_long.bed_temp_avg` (disagreement 5) — belong to the scoped
  config-retune stage, not this one.
- Open sub-model-1 advisor questions (drum GA / level-transmitter span; CBD
  conductivity analyser) unchanged.

## What I could not verify
- **`E_P`** rests on `M_drum_metal` (ASSUMED 18000 kg) and `cp_bw` from IF97 at
  the saturation point; the derived 679 J/Pa could not be checked against a
  measured pressure time constant for this boiler. Correction 1's independent
  physical estimate (0.8–1.2e3) is the closest available cross-check and agrees
  to ~1.2×.
- **The bed conductance split `G_FG` + `G_WW`** (`BETA_FURNACE = 0.45`) is an
  engineering lump: the in-bed water-wall heat-transfer area and coefficient are
  not known for this boiler. It was introduced because `G_FG` alone made the bed
  ~2.5× too sensitive (a 3.5 t/h leak quenched the average bed 45 °C; family E
  crossed 880). The *ratio* `G_WW/G_FG ≈ 1.55` is plausible for an AFBC bed but
  unverified.
- **`K_MS_FLOW`, `K_MS_BED`, `K_BED_LOAD`** magnitudes are ASSUMED with ranges;
  the fingerprint gives a bed~load slope (3.9, different boiler) but no
  discriminating value for the superheater terms. Confirming would need plant
  transient data.
- **Family-C and family-E bed magnitudes** (disagreements 5, 6) — the RCA cases
  describe direction and rough shape, not numbers. Verifying the −78 °C
  feeder-trip drop or the +12–20 °C fouling rise needs plant data.
- **The `_fire` / firing-controller lag (60 s)** and the pressure-trim gain
  (0.06 per kg/cm2) are controller tunings, unsourced both before and after;
  changed only to keep the faster physical `E_P` stable. Documented, not
  verified.
