# Phase 0b / board setup (Fedora laptop + QIDK) — report

## Status
DONE for the setup and the campaign runner; the campaign itself has NOT been run (the human launches it). llama.cpp
pinned and built, 4 candidate GGUFs built to the recipe, pushed and checksum-verified, smoke test passed (B, C, D),
CLAUDE.md and `/board-up` updated, unattended campaign runner built and tested against a fake board. No timing,
accuracy or energy result exists for any candidate beyond the smoke-test calls below. Step-by-step state:
`reports/session2_setup_progress.md`.

## Human decision: quantization recipe (recorded before any board run)

**Decision (human, 2026-10-03), identical for all 4 candidates** (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen3 1.7B, Gemma 3 1B QAT,
Qwen2.5 0.5B Instruct):

- every weight matrix Q4_0; token embedding and output at Q8_0. Both types are allowed by the committed rule
  ("every weight matrix Q4_0 or Q8_0", `reports/phase0b_lanes_model_choice.md`, hard constraints).
- built with `llama-quantize --pure --token-embedding-type q8_0 --output-tensor-type q8_0 <src> <dst> Q4_0`;
- from the original 16-bit weights: official safetensors through `convert_hf_to_gguf.py`. If a repo is gated and not
  yet approved, a well-known F16/BF16 GGUF mirror, with repo, file and sha256 recorded;
- Gemma: if Google's QAT Q4_0 GGUF already matches this recipe under `bench.gguf_types`, use it as is; otherwise
  build it from `google/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized`.

**Reason (human):** published "Q4_0" files carry K-quant / Q4_1 tensors, which fall back to the CPU on HTP. Confirmed
on the board's `geniex/models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf` (bartowski, 1,921,909,280 B), whose header has
`token_embd.weight` (tied output) at Q6_K and 3 `ffn_down` tensors at Q4_1 (`bench.gguf_types`, 2026-10-03).

**Earlier 3B rates are on the impure file.** The earlier Llama 3.2 3B rates, 839 tok/s prefill and 11.7 tok/s
decode (figures reported by the human; their measurement is not in this repo), were measured on that impure file.
They are not comparable with any rate from the recipe above and must not be mixed with them.

## Human decision: context size and slots (2026-10-03)
`llama-server` is always launched with `-c 4096 -np 1`, the same for every model and both lanes, because the
single-agent prompt is ~2484 tokens and context size changes NPU speed. Code: `bench/board.py` (`CTX_SIZE`,
`N_PARALLEL`, `lane_command`); test: `tests/test_board_env.py::test_lanes_always_use_ctx_4096_np_1`.

## Human decisions on the mirror, EOS and launch flags (2026-10-03, after the laptop-side build)
1. **Safetensors mirrors accepted for the two gated models.** Reason: the weights are the official files. How the
   identity was established: the Hub's API (`model_info(..., files_metadata=True)`) returns the LFS sha256 of every
   file even for a gated repo that cannot be downloaded. Those published hashes were read for the official repos and
   compared with the mirrors' published hashes, then `~/fieldmind-build/fetch_weights.py` recomputed sha256 over the
   downloaded bytes and required equality (`logs/fetch_weights.log`, `OK` lines):
   - `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` == `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`:
     `model-00001-of-00002.safetensors` `13cbd6d16e927a0c5bad54102514e6e18b4a47b3a6eb911e39d678d328d19f55`,
     `model-00002-of-00002.safetensors` `7b770216613ac5c34d7c54bdff1fa616bc4e338a9d0b20af6303e48c295ee23c`;
   - `google/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized` == `unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it-qat`:
     `model.safetensors` `6d571889049c5550a2cdcc3e1846646e595b683ce0d3c7bea904ed8874cf8ef2`,
     `tokenizer.model` `1299c11d7cf632ef3b4e11937501358ada021bbdf7c47638d13c0ee982f2e79c`.
   Limit: the identity covers those LFS files only. The mirrors' small JSON files differ from the official ones.
2. **Gemma EOS id = 1 accepted**, to match Google's own GGUF.
3. **`-fit off` accepted on both lanes**, so the server cannot change the context size or the offload on its own.
   **`-lv 4`**: decided by the fixed 5% rule after the measurement (smoke test, step C): kept everywhere.

## Human decisions for the campaign (2026-10-03, committed before any further board run)
- **`-lv 4` rule, fixed in advance.** If `-lv 4` lowers prefill or decode tok/s by more than 5% (calls 2-3 of each
  launch), it is used only for a one-off offload-confirmation launch per model and all timed calls run at the default
  log level. Otherwise `-lv 4` stays everywhere. Which case applied is recorded with the numbers.
- **Option C.** All 4 candidates are screened; full dev runs only for Llama 3.2 3B and the one other model that passes
  the GGUF and offload checks with the lowest measured verified-diagnosis time. Reason: limited board time.
- **The campaign runs unattended.** Every decision point is applied by code from rules committed in advance; the model
  is chosen by `bench/model_choice.py` unchanged, not by the human. Flags are recorded and do not stop the run.
  Reason: the rules are mechanical and already committed.
- **Go-ahead condition after the smoke test** (no waiting for the human only if ALL hold): every layer and the final
  logits step run on HTP0 with a nonzero HTP0 buffer; the Gemma tokenizer check gave identical IDs on every dev
  prompt; the Gemma call stopped by itself. Otherwise stop and report.

## Step A: Gemma tokenizer check (laptop only) — passes against the accepted reference (Hugging Face tokenizer)
Prompts: no dev prompts were recorded on this machine, so they were recorded now: mock dev run at HEAD with
`--log-prompts` (36 dev episodes; 2,174 prompts = 1,982 diagnostician + 192 verifier; 2,084 distinct). Verifier
prompts embed the mock's diagnostician answer, so they are real prompt shapes, not the prompts a real model would
produce. Each prompt was wrapped as one user message in the chat template (jinja2). Our template and Google's
render **identical text on all 2,084**. Tokenized with the pinned `llama-tokenize` (`--no-bos --no-escape`, special
tokens parsed). Evidence: `~/fieldmind-build/tokcheck/`.

| comparison (token IDs, 2,084 distinct dev prompts) | identical |
|---|---|
| our Gemma GGUF vs Google's own QAT GGUF vocabulary, as published (the reference compared against earlier) | **0 / 2,084** |
| our Gemma GGUF vs the Hugging Face tokenizer (`transformers`, a different implementation; `tokenizer.model` sha256-identical to Google's) | 2,084 / 2,084 |
| our Gemma GGUF vs Google's GGUF vocabulary with ONE key added, `tokenizer.ggml.add_space_prefix = false` | 2,084 / 2,084 |

- The mismatch is exactly one extra token per prompt on Google's side, and the first differing token is `▁user`
  (2430) where ours and Hugging Face give `user` (2364).
- **Cause, tested:** Google's GGUF has no `tokenizer.ggml.add_space_prefix` key; the pinned llama.cpp then inserts a
  space after a special token. Adding that single key (value false, as the pinned converter writes) makes all 2,084
  identical. So the difference is in how this llama.cpp reads Google's older file, not in our vocabulary.
- **The 30 differing token spellings** are ids 138-167: runs of 2 to 31 `U+2581` in Google's GGUF, runs of 2 to 31
  plain spaces in ours (id 138 = 2, id 139 = 3, ..., id 167 = 31); token type 1 (normal) in Google's, 4
  (user-defined) in ours. Four of them occur in the dev prompts (ids 138, 139, 151, 155; 18,380 occurrences in total)
  and are produced identically by all three tokenizers.
- **HUMAN DECISION (2026-10-03): the Hugging Face tokenizer is the accepted reference for Gemma.** Reason: its
  `tokenizer.model` is sha256-identical to Google's, so it is the tokenizer the model was trained with; Google's GGUF
  is a converted copy, and its mismatch is caused by a missing `add_space_prefix` key under this llama.cpp version
  (tested above). **The check passes 2,084 of 2,084.**
- **Limits of this check.** (1) It covers input prompts recorded with the mock, so real-model verifier prompts are
  not covered. (2) The ~6,400 differing scores and token types between our file and Google's GGUF are unexplained,
  with no effect on any of the 2,084 prompts.

## Smoke test on the board (Llama 3.2 3B, new pure file, NPU lane, `-c 4096 -np 1 -fit off`)
GGUFs pushed to `/data/local/tmp/llm/`; `sha256sum` on the board equals the laptop value for all 4. Lanes load only
files in `bench.board.CANDIDATES` whose board sha256 matches (tested), so the old impure file cannot be loaded.

### B. Offload and where the final logits step runs
One-off diagnostic launch (`GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2`, `-lv 5`, one 38-token request; not a timed run).
Log: `logs/smoke_B_diag_sched_npu.log`.

| item | value from the startup log |
|---|---|
| tensor types (server's own loader) | f32 58, q4_0 196, q8_0 1: identical to `bench.gguf_types` |
| layers offloaded to HTP0 | **29 of 29** (27 repeating + the output layer; `offloading output layer to GPU`) |
| HTP0 model buffer | **1,911.90 MiB** (nonzero) |
| CPU model buffer | 399.23 MiB |
| HTP0 KV buffer / compute buffer | 448.00 MiB / 64.01 MiB |
| slots, context | `n_slots = 1`, `n_ctx_slot = 4096` |

- **Where the token embedding lives: in both places.** The loader keeps one copy on the CPU
  (`'token_embd.weight' (q8_0) ... using CPU`) for the input lookup, and a second copy inside the HTP0 buffer for the
  tied output layer. Independent check: the Q8_0 table is 128,256 x 3,072 values at 34 bytes per 32 values =
  399.23 MiB, equal to the CPU buffer; and the HTP0 buffer (1,911.90 MiB) equals llama-quantize's total quant size
  for ALL tensors (1,911.90 MiB), which is only possible if the embedding is counted there too.
- **The final logits step runs on HTP0.** Scheduler assignment, every graph: `node #873 (MUL_MAT): result_output
  [HTP0]`, with inputs `token_embd.weight (399M) [HTP0]` and `result_norm [HTP0]`.
- **The only CPU operation is the input embedding lookup** (`GET_ROWS embd`, one per graph, 10 of 10 graphs). Every
  other node is on HTP0: per graph 197 MUL_MAT (196 weight matrices + the logits), plus RMS_NORM, MUL, ROPE, ADD,
  SWIGLU, FLASH_ATTN.
- Limit: this is the scheduler's assignment, printed by the server. It is not a hardware trace of the DSP.

### C. Cost of `-lv 4` (numbers for the human's fixed rule)
Same diagnostician prompt (dev_A01-shaped, ep_A01 tick 64), `max_tokens` 256, through `LlamaServerBackend`; 3 calls
per launch, 60 s cooldown before each launch and between calls. Raw: `logs/smoke_C.json`.

| launch | call | prompt tok | answer tok | prefill tok/s | decode tok/s | chip before (CPU/NPU C) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `-lv 4` | 1 (first of launch) | 2,081 | 182 | 932.32 | 16.378 | 42.2 / 37.4 |
| `-lv 4` | 2 | 2,081 | 182 | 900.28 | 16.257 | 35.9 / 35.1 |
| `-lv 4` | 3 | 2,081 | 182 | 896.83 | 16.208 | 36.3 / 35.9 |
| default | 1 (first of launch) | 2,081 | 182 | 921.12 | 16.199 | 44.9 / 39.7 |
| default | 2 | 2,081 | 182 | 901.25 | 15.992 | 37.4 / 36.6 |
| default | 3 | 2,081 | 182 | 897.45 | 16.033 | 36.4 / 37.0 |

| calls 2-3, mean | `-lv 4` | default | `-lv 4` relative to default |
|---|---|---|---|
| prefill tok/s | 898.56 | 899.35 | -0.09% |
| decode tok/s | 16.233 | 16.013 | +1.37% |

- **Rule applied (fixed by the human before these numbers):** `-lv 4` lowers neither rate by more than 5%, so
  **`-lv 4` stays everywhere** (`bench.board.TIMED_LOG_LEVEL = 4`).
- Limits: two calls per condition, one prompt, one model. This shows no large cost; it is not a precise estimate.
- The reply text was identical in all 6 calls (temperature 0, seed 0).
- These are the first rates on the recipe file: about 900 tok/s prefill and 16.1 tok/s decode at a 2,081-token
  prompt. They are NOT comparable with the earlier 839 / 11.7 tok/s (impure file, other build, conditions unknown).
- The first call of a launch prefills 2.5-3.7% faster than calls 2-3 and starts on a warmer chip (42-45 C vs 36-37 C,
  right after the model load). Cause not investigated.

### D. Gemma stops by itself; Qwen3 thinking-off mechanism
One short prompt each on the NPU lane (`logs/smoke_D.json`, startup logs `logs/smoke_D_lane_npu_*.log`).

| model | request | stop reason | answer tok (cap) | `<end_of_turn>` in text | reasoning text | layers on HTP0 | HTP0 buffer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 3 1B QAT | plain | `stop` | 33 (256) | no | none | 27 / 27 incl. output | 680.82 MiB |
| Qwen3 1.7B | `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}` | `stop` | 10 (400) | no | none | 29 / 29 incl. output | 1,071.77 MiB |
| Qwen3 1.7B | default (thinking on) | `length` | 400 (400) | no | 1,877 chars, content empty | same launch | same |

- **Gemma: the reply stopped by itself** (stop reason `stop`, not the token limit) and contains no `<end_of_turn>` text.
- **Qwen3 thinking-off mechanism, recorded as the committed rule requires:** per-request
  `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}`. Evidence: with it, no reasoning and a 10-token answer; without
  it, the whole 400-token budget went to reasoning and the content was empty. At this llama.cpp the server moves
  thinking into `message.reasoning_content`, so a `<think>` test on the content alone would miss it: the screening
  check fails Qwen3 on a `<think>` tag in the content OR any non-empty `reasoning_content`.
- For both models the server's loader type counts equal `bench.gguf_types`.

### Go-ahead conditions (human, fixed in advance): all hold
| condition | result |
|---|---|
| every layer and the final logits step on HTP0, nonzero HTP0 buffer | yes: 29/29, `result_output` on HTP0, 1,911.90 MiB |
| Gemma tokenizer check identical on every dev prompt | yes: 2,084 / 2,084 against the accepted reference |
| the Gemma call stopped by itself | yes: stop reason `stop` at 33 of 256 tokens |

## Human decisions on two runner choices (2026-10-03, before any screening or dev result)
1. **Stage C floor = the mock run of the same 3 dev episodes.** Reason: like-for-like with the models' scores. The
   committed 0.501 is to be printed beside it. Current runner: the mock floor is in `C/model_choice.txt`/`.json`;
   0.501 is NOT printed by the runner (adding it is a code change, not made); compare by hand with `FLOOR_DEFAULT`.
2. **"Measured verified-diagnosis time" = mean server time of the screening calls, short answers counted as they
   are**, with the rate-based projection printed beside it for every model. Current runner: `A/screening.json` holds
   `measured_verified_s` and `projected_verified_s` for all 4 models.

**Proposed amendment NOT made: option C stays.** The human proposed dev rounds for every model that passes
screening, to be made only if it were a job-list or config change. It is not: it changes the stage A selection,
the stage B model list and its stop rule (`both dropped` -> `all dropped`), and the tests that assert option C. Per
the human's condition, nothing was changed; the committed runner (`a75bdc1`) is unchanged.

## Campaign runner (built, tested on a fake board, not launched)
Code: `bench/campaign.py`, `scripts/board_campaign.sh`; tests `tests/test_campaign.py` with `tests/fake_board.py`
(a local HTTP server that speaks `/health`, `/tokenize` and `/v1/chat/completions`, with fault injection).
`fieldmind/` is untouched; `bench/harness.run_episode` gained an optional `on_tick` callback (telemetry only; the
mock reporting run still equals `single_v3_summary.json` on every key outside latency: 1,659 paths, 0 differences).

Launch, once, from the repo root: `tmux new -s campaign 'scripts/board_campaign.sh all'`.
Status: `results/board/STATUS.md`. Exit codes: 0 finished, 2 infrastructure stop, 3 stopped by a committed rule.

| requirement | how it is met | test |
|---|---|---|
| ordered job list, manifest, resume | `results/board/manifest.json`; a job is complete only if its summary file exists (written last, atomically) | `test_complete_episode_is_skipped_incomplete_is_redone` |
| per-call JSONL, flushed at once | `CallLog`: flush + fsync per record; fields: laptop time, stage/phase, model, sha256, server flags, episode, tick, lane, prompt sha + full prompt, raw reply, parse status, stop reason, server timings (None if missing), chip temperature | `test_call_is_logged_at_once_with_every_field`, `test_missing_server_timings_are_none` |
| per-episode record | git commit, code hash, llama.cpp commit (read from the board), full config, start/end temperature, thermal wait, network state, energy `null` | full dry run |
| reply cache | key = sha256(model sha, server flags, sampling params incl. `max_tokens` and extra body, prompt sha); hits are marked and carry no timing | `test_cache_*` (3 tests) |
| infrastructure failures | `CampaignBackend` raises `InfraFailure` (connection, HTTP error, timeout, malformed body, failed temperature read); the episode is INCOMPLETE, the lane is health-checked and restarted, 3 retries, then a clean stop with the position in `STATUS.md` and the manifest | `test_infra_failure_is_retried_and_never_scored` (4 fault types), `test_adb_drop_is_infrastructure`, `test_stops_cleanly_after_three_retries_and_resumes`, `test_run_all_returns_infra_exit_code` |
| thermal gate | within 5 C of the idle temperature measured at campaign start, 15 s polls, 15 min cap, wait logged | 2 tests |
| `results/board/` tracked, commit per stage, never push | `.gitignore` un-ignores it (scratch `tmp/` and `cache/` stay ignored); `git commit -- results/board` after each stage | not tested (tests run with `--no-commit`) |
| one script, stages A-E | `scripts/board_campaign.sh all` under `systemd-inhibit` | full dry run |
| status file | `STATUS.md` rewritten after every episode | full dry run, stop tests |
| stage rules | A: option C; B: interleaved rounds and the 0.30 / 0.10 drop; C: `bench.model_choice` run unchanged as a subprocess; D: round-robin N, A, B, C, D, E; E: only if the 3-episode verdict is INCONCLUSIVE, reusing the 3 episodes | 9 tests |
| kill and resume | `SIGKILL` delivered mid-episode to the real CLI process, then relaunch | `test_kill_minus_9_mid_episode_then_resume_is_identical` |

### Verification (runner)
| step | result |
|---|---|
| ran the module | full fake campaign A-E through the real CLI: exit 0, 50 jobs, 4,955 model calls, 26 s. Real-board interface exercised once outside the campaign: `bench.gguf_types` over adb OK, lane start, offload parsed (29/29, 1,911.9 MiB), `/tokenize`, one 700/60 and one 350/30 call (server prompt tokens exactly 700 and 350; 60 and 30 answer tokens) |
| self-tests | 135 passed / 0 failed (29 new in `tests/test_campaign.py`; the suite now takes about 80 s) |
| independent re-derivation | kill-and-resume: the resumed campaign's summaries, run records, model-choice output and stage decisions equal an uninterrupted run's on every non-timing field (99 files compared). The measured screening time is recomputed in the test from the raw call records and equals the runner's value; the fake projection equals the hand value 1050/900 + 90/16 = 6.79 s |
| mutation check | 23 distinct mutations, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, all caught: cache-hit timings kept; log not flushed; cache key without server flags; without sampling; hit not marked; no retry; retries 3 -> 1; HTTP 500 returned as a model reply; complete without a summary; thermal margin 5 -> 10; max wait 900 -> 300; second model slowest; screening 700 -> 800; reasoning text unchecked; offload ignoring layer count / output layer / zero buffer; drop limit 0.30 -> 0.60; family order; adb drop ignored; cache not reloaded after a kill; stage E condition inverted; no-pick not stopping. Two were first NOT caught for the right reason (offload layer count: no test; drop limit: the test was failing anyway); tests were added/fixed and both re-run |

### Decisions taken in the runner (conservative choice each time; all reversible before launch)
1. **Cache hit = replay, timings nulled.** A hit returns the stored reply; afterwards its call timings and the
   envelope latency are set to `None` in the run record, so `bench.model_choice` (unchanged) leaves it out of rates,
   the projection and call-time means. Token counts stay. Per-tick wall time (S1, S7) of a tick answered from the
   cache is the real, short wall time; such ticks are marked `cache_hit`.
2. **Screening calls never use the cache** and start with one warm-up call that is logged and excluded (the first
   call of a launch was 2.5-3.7% faster in prefill in step C).
3. **Screening prompts** are the first real diagnostician prompt (dev_A01 tick 37) and verifier prompt (dev_B01 tick
   51) from the mock runs, cut with the server's own tokenizer to exactly 700 / 350 prompt tokens with the output
   schema kept at the end. Answers are capped at 60 / 30; a shorter answer is counted (`short_answers`), not padded.
4. **"Measured verified-diagnosis time"** = mean server time (prefill + decode) of the five 700/60 calls + mean of
   the five 350/30 calls. The projection beside it is `model_choice.projected_s` at the same calls' pooled rates.
5. **Screening pass** = GGUF check + offload check (+ no thinking for Qwen3). The 10 s projected limit is NOT a
   screening gate; it is applied by `model_choice` in stage C, as committed.
6. **Qwen3 thinking off** = per-request `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}`; it fails screening on a
   `<think>` tag in the content OR any non-empty `reasoning_content`.
7. **Idle temperature** is measured once, at campaign start, with no lane running (stable to 0.5 C), and kept in the
   manifest across restarts. If the board is warm at launch, the gate is correspondingly looser.
8. **Stage E reuse** of the 3 model-choice episodes requires an unchanged hash of `fieldmind/`, `bench/`, `configs/`
   and `data/kb/` (result commits do not move it); otherwise all 13 are run.
9. **The mock column** for stage C's floor is the mock run of the same 3 dev episodes, computed at stage C.
10. **Baseline name:** `results/baselines/single_v3_real_<model>_npu_summary.json`.
11. **Timeout:** the config's 120 s per call. A timeout is infrastructure (human rule), so a model that needs more
    than 120 s for one call would stop the campaign, not be scored.

## Verification
| step | result |
|---|---|
| ran the module | `bench/build_candidate_gguf.sh` ran for all 4, exit 0 each; `bench.board env/temp/start/log/stop` ran against the board (before it was unplugged) |
| self-tests | 103 passed / 0 failed (`.venv/bin/python -m pytest`), 5 new in `tests/test_board_env.py` |
| independent re-derivation | tensor-type counts of each candidate by llama.cpp's own `gguf-py` `GGUFReader` (a different parser): identical to `bench.gguf_types` for all 4, relative difference 0. Also: for the impure on-board file, llama-server's loader printed `f32 58, q4_0 193, q4_1 3, q6_K 1`, identical to `bench.gguf_types` on its header (the "first real file" check left open in `phase0b_lanes_model_choice.md`) |
| mutation check | `CTX_SIZE` 4096 -> 2048: caught by `test_lanes_always_use_ctx_4096_np_1`. `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` removed from the launch: caught by `test_lane_command_env_and_offload`. `drop_pythonpath()` removed: caught by `test_board_script_drops_pythonpath`. `env=clean_env()` removed from the adb call: caught by `test_adb_subprocess_gets_clean_env`. Build-script gate: fed the impure bartowski header, the `verdict OK` grep fails (exit 3 path) |

## Direction checks
None: no physical response was modelled in this stage.

## Constants introduced
| symbol | value | provenance | range | affects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CTX_SIZE` | 4096 | human decision 2026-10-03 (equals `llm.llamaserver.ctx_size`, itself derived in the config) | fixed | NPU speed, KV buffer size; every lane launch |
| `N_PARALLEL` | 1 | human decision 2026-10-03; CLAUDE.md "one request at a time" | fixed | one slot per lane |
| `TIMED_LOG_LEVEL` | `-lv 4` | found on the board: the default level prints no loader lines; kept for timed calls by the human's 5% rule (measured -0.09% prefill, +1.37% decode) | 4 or higher | whether the NPU-confirmation rule can be checked on every launch |
| `-fit` | off | conservative: no argument may be adjusted silently (HTP0 reports 0 MiB free) | on/off | layer placement |

## Numbers that changed
| quantity | old | new | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Llama 3.2 3B file | 1,921,909,280 B (bartowski: 193 Q4_0, 3 Q4_1, token_embd Q6_K) | 2,012,612,832 B (196 Q4_0, token_embd Q8_0) | ratio 1.047. The earlier 839 / 11.7 tok/s belong to the old file |
| tests | 98 | 135 | 29 for the campaign runner, 8 for the board helpers |

## Decisions taken
1. **Toolchain image pulled.** The message said the snapdragon-toolchain container was already in `podman images`; it
   was not (only `ubuntu:22.04`). Pulled the image the pinned llama.cpp docs name. NDK is r29 in the image.
2. **Safetensors mirrors, not GGUF mirrors, for the two gated models.** The instruction for a gated repo was an
   F16/BF16 GGUF mirror. I used safetensors mirrors whose weight files have the same sha256 as the official gated files
   (the Hub publishes LFS hashes for gated repos): both Llama shards equal Meta's; Gemma `model.safetensors` and
   `tokenizer.model` equal `google/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized`. That keeps the recipe's primary path
   (official weights through `convert_hf_to_gguf.py`, lossless BF16). Reversible: nothing downstream has run.
3. **Gemma: Google's QAT GGUF not used.** Checked on the byte-identical copy in `tetf/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-q4_0-GGUF`
   (sha256 `95e5b8d8...` equals Google's): `token_embd.weight` is F16, so it does not match the recipe.
4. **Gemma EOS restored to 1.** unsloth's tokenizer files set EOS to `<end_of_turn>` (106). Google's own GGUF and the
   `mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-bf16` config say `<eos>` (1). Built with
   `--override-kv tokenizer.ggml.eos_token_id=int:1`; verified 1 in the output.
5. **Llama metadata left as converted.** Chat template, tokens, token types, merges, BOS/EOS are identical to the
   Meta-derived `bartowski/...-f16.gguf` header. unsloth adds `padding_token_id` 128004; left in (unused here).
6. **`-lv 4` and `-fit off` added to the launch command** (see Constants).
7. **Build tree outside the repo:** `~/fieldmind-build/` (new folder; nothing existing was changed).
8. **`logs/` added to `.gitignore`.**

## Disagreements recorded, not resolved
- **The premise of the "only Q4_0 or Q8_0" rule does not hold at the pinned llama.cpp, by source.** CLAUDE.md says
  K-quants silently fall back to the CPU on HTP. At commit `99b9548`, `ggml_hexagon_supported_mul_mat`
  (`ggml/src/ggml-hexagon/ggml-hexagon.cpp`) accepts Q4_0, Q4_1, Q8_0, IQ4_NL, MXFP4 and Q2_K-Q6_K weights. So the
  old impure file (Q4_1, Q6_K) may well run fully on HTP0 with this build. **Not tested on the board** (no request
  was timed or traced on that file). The rule and the recipe are human decisions and are unchanged; the recipe still
  gives one uniform, reproducible file per model. Whether the rule's stated reason should be reworded is the
  human's call.
- Gemma tokenizer arrays: against Google's own GGUF, my conversion differs in 30 token spellings (ids 138-167, `▁`
  runs vs spaces), 6,414 scores and 6,407 token types. The sentencepiece `tokenizer.model` is byte-identical, so I
  attribute this to the converter version. **Not tested** (would need Google's file converted by the pinned converter,
  which needs the gated repo). Recorded as unexplained-but-probable, not as verified.
- Gemma chat template: Google's GGUF stores a flattened one-line template whose system prefix ends in one newline; the
  HF template (unsloth and mlx copies, identical to each other) uses two. Irrelevant to this project's requests
  (single user message, `LlamaServerBackend._body`); it would matter if a system message were ever sent.

## Blocked / needs a decision
- Launching the campaign is the human's action: `tmux new -s campaign 'scripts/board_campaign.sh all'`.
- Whether the Q4_0/Q8_0 rule's stated reason should be reworded, given the Hexagon source finding (see Disagreements).

## What I could not verify
- That every operation runs on the NPU. The dry run (impure on-board file, launch mechanics only, no request sent, no
  timings taken) showed `offloading output layer to GPU`, `offloaded 29/29 layers`, `HTP0 model buffer size = 1845.95
  MiB`, `CPU model buffer size = 308.23 MiB`. That is weight placement, not execution. The 308 MiB CPU buffer is
  probably the input embedding table; not checked.
- Gemma: my Q4_0 tensors were not compared bit-for-bit with Google's QAT GGUF (needs the full 1 GB file).
- The unsloth small files (config, tokenizer_config) against the official gated ones, beyond the comparisons above.
- No accuracy or energy number exists for any candidate. Timing exists only for the smoke-test calls above.
- The campaign runner has never run a real episode on the board; only its board interface was exercised (one lane
  start and three calls). The per-stage `git commit` path is untested (tests run with `--no-commit`).
- A resumed real campaign can differ from an uninterrupted one in timing-based fields (rates, call-time means, the
  third tie-break of the model-choice rule), because redone calls answered from the cache have no timing.
- NPU replies were identical across 6 repeats of one prompt; determinism across lane restarts over a whole episode
  is assumed by the cache, not measured.
- Campaign duration is a planning estimate, not a measurement: mock call counts x 13.6 s per 3B call give about
  1.1 h (stage B, 3B only) + 8.8 h (stage D) + 4.5 h (stage E) = 14.4 h if the 3B is chosen, plus the second model's
  dev runs, thermal waits and repair calls.
- The server's own `predicted_per_second` differs from tokens / `predicted_ms` on the same call (19.15 vs 19.81 tok/s
  on one 30-token call). Unexplained; every rate in this project uses tokens / server ms, as `model_choice` does.
