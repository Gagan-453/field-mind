 L1  --  THE DETERMINISTIC CHECK LAYER  (Plan §4)
=============================================================================

Ordinary Python with numeric thresholds.  No model involved.  Runs on every
tick regardless of what else is happening.

It produces FACTS: statements that are true by construction.  Everything
downstream is only allowed to INTERPRET facts, never to contradict them.

Five families:
    LIMIT     is a value outside its band right now?
    RATE      is it moving too fast, or steadily in one direction?
    BALANCE   do the physics still add up?          <- most of the value
    VALIDITY  is the instrument itself believable?
    PATTERN   does a known named signature match?

Thresholds live in the config (configs/base.yaml -> checks:) not in this file,
because tuning them against the normal episodes to hit the false-positive
target Q5 is an explicit phase-2 activity (Plan §A.5).

Pure stdlib -- this module runs on the device.
