 WORLD MODEL UPDATE  (Plan §5)
=============================================================================

This is what makes the system an agent rather than a classifier: belief is
carried from tick to tick and updated by an explainable rule, not a learned
one.

Four update rules (Plan §5.1):
  1. UP    when a newly observed fact is in the hypothesis's expected evidence
  2. DOWN  when a fact the hypothesis PREDICTS should be present is ABSENT
           -- absence of expected evidence is information, and this is the
           part most systems skip
  3. DOWN HARD when a fact directly contradicts it
  4. RETIRE below a floor, so the agent does not silently keep a dead idea alive

Log-odds accumulation with bounded per-tick increments. Close enough to
Bayesian to defend in the writeup, and it cannot blow up.
