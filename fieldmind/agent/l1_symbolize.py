 L1b  --  SYMBOLIZER  (Plan §4, feeds §6.2)
=============================================================================

Turns the Fact list into two things:

  1. an EVIDENCE PACKET -- the compressed, token-cheap text the LLM will see.
     The language model NEVER sees raw numbers. It sees facts.

  2. a SIGNATURE -- a sparse dict over (tag, direction, magnitude_band)
     triples, used for case matching in L3.

Why symbolize at all: 720 raw samples x 6 tags is ~4300 numbers per tick. At
roughly one token per number that is a 4 k prefill before we have said
anything. The same information as facts is 150-300 tokens. On the NPU, where
prefill dominates, that is the difference between fitting in a 1024 static
shape and not.
