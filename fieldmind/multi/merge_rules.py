=============================================================================
 MERGE RULES  --  how a checked model answer reaches the published ranking
 (accuracy-fix work, reports/multi_accuracy_fix.md, human decision 1 and its
 amendment)
=============================================================================

Pure functions: belief's live hypotheses and the expanded model answer in, the
published hypotheses out. No board, no backend. Used by the gate and by the
offline replay (bench/replay_multi.py), so the two cannot disagree.

  model        the single agent's `merge` (model order wins). Phase 1-4
               behaviour; not handled here, the gate keeps calling `merge`.
  belief_only  belief's own top 3, exactly as `initial_claims` builds them.
               The model's answer is logged and ignored.
  tiebreak     PRIMARY (decision 1, option B). Published order = belief's.
               The model may reorder only belief's LEADERS: live cases whose
               log-odds are within BAND of the best. Cases it ranks that are in
               the band come first, in its order; the rest of the band follows
               in belief's order; everything outside the band keeps its place.
               Recomputed every tick; nothing is written to belief.
  nudge        SECONDARY arm (option A). Every tick a FRESH answer (not a
               reused one) adds STEP to its rank-1 case and STEP/2 to its
               rank-2 case, at most once per case per tick, each case's total
               capped at CAP for the episode. Published order = belief's
               log-odds + that offset. The offsets are kept on the board
               (`model_evidence`, owned by the gate), NOT added to the
               Hypothesis objects: belief's own update, retirement and the
               single agent's belief are untouched, and the offset can be
               reported and removed.

Constants (all CITED, fieldmind/agent/world_model.py):
