 BLACKBOARD  --  the shared world model, one writer per section
 (docs/multi_agent_plan.pdf, "Blackboard and messages")
=============================================================================

Agents never call each other; they read and write named sections here. Every
section has exactly ONE writer (OWNERS below). The rule is enforced in code,
three ways:

  1. write(section, value, writer)   raises WriterError for a non-owner
  2. mutable(section, writer)        hands the live object only to the owner
  3. audit mode (multi.audit_writes) fingerprints every section before and
     after each agent step (`step()`), and raises WriterError if a section
     changed that the stepping agent does not own. This is the one that
     matters in practice: the reused world-model functions
     (world_model.update_findings, update_hypotheses ...) mutate in place, so
     an agent handed the wrong object would otherwise write silently.

read(section) returns read-only containers (tuple / frozenset /
MappingProxyType), so an accidental write to the TOP level of a section through
a read handle fails at once. This is SHALLOW: the objects inside (a Hypothesis,
a case dict) are the live ones, and only the audit catches a change to them.
With audit_writes off, enforcement is the API check alone.

The sections map onto the single agent's WorldModel fields where one exists,
so the same object can be inspected either way. Events (the timeline) are
written only by gate+memory: other agents post this tick's events to their own
outbox section and the gate appends them, in pipeline order.

Fact IDs: facts are kept per tick and indexed by their TICK-STAMPED id
(`t84.F1`). The Fact objects themselves keep the local id (`F1`) because the
prompt text must stay identical to the single agent's in Phase 1; the stamp
lives in the index, and the gate resolves citations against the facts of the
answer's EVIDENCE tick.
