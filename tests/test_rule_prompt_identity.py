"""Accuracy-fix risk 1: the merge rule must not feed back into what the model
is asked. Runs the same episodes under every merge rule on the mock (with a
verifier that fails claims, so verdicts differ too) and asserts, tick for
tick, that every diagnostician and text-reader prompt is identical and the
call-or-reuse decision is identical. The verifier's prompt shows the
PUBLISHED claims, so it is expected to differ; that is asserted as well, so
the exception is documented by a test, not by prose."""
